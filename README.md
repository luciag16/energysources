# Renewable Energy Analysis with Power BI
## Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize renewable energy production data across European Union countries using Power BI.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python (Pandas)**: Data cleaning and aggregation.
- **Excel**: Initial data source.

## Steps and Process
1. **Data Import and Preparation**
   - Imported raw data from an Excel file into Python using Pandas.
   - Filtered the dataset to include only European Union countries and relevant main categories.
   - Converted energy values from terajoules (TJ) to terawatt-hours (TWh).

2. **Data Cleaning and Aggregation**
   - Cleaned the data to retain necessary columns.
   - Aggregated the data by country, energy source, and year.

3. **Visualization and Dashboard Creation**
   - Created various visuals in Power BI:
     - Bar chart for total energy production by country.
     - Stacked bar chart for top 3 energy sources for each country.
     - Map chart for geographical distribution of energy production.
     - Donut chart for proportion of total energy production by source.

4. **Interactivity**
   - Added slicers for year and country in Power BI.
   - Implemented dynamic titles based on selected filters.
